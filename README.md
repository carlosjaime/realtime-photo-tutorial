A short tutorial on uploading images and broacasting them in realtime using [RethinkDB changefeeds](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/) and [RethinkDB binary data](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#binary).

## Setup

After installing RethinkDB and Node.js, install all packages with npm:

After that, run the server:
